3/3/20: I've reorganized the files so that this README can be updated according to recent pushes/commits. The main.dart file was also uploaded and should be shown above this file

In changes to the main.dart file, i've added the navigation to the second screen and a text field. The classes/states have been created for all the screens, they only need re-formatting.
